Rev42NewHyb - Hybrid Opt. Combining all disturbances in Inverse Opt. for fast speeds (no inside). Cost on closeness. If mean_diff is less than 2.5 sigma, Forward opt is done. Forward opt without perturbations for 15s (5sec trancient effects, 10 seconds to walk stably). Final cost (no fall/stable walking) on energy and speed (contains a bug! Speed was not done absolute, so slower speeds gives lower cost)
REv42HybWindows - Hybrid Opt, starting point Rev42, on a windows com, with a very low sigma. Only cost was slightly different (now with abs diff on velocity, cost on velocity diff was 3 instead of 10)
Rev46Hyb - Hybrid Opt. Combining all disturbances in Inverse Opt. for fast speeds (no inside). Cost on closeness. If mean_diff is less than 3 sigma, Forward opt is done. Forward opt without perturbations for 15s (5sec trancient effects, 10 seconds to walk stably). Final cost (no fall/stable walking) on energy and absolute speed. 
Rev51Hyb - Hybrid Opt. Combining all dists. in inverse, for fast speed (no inside), cost on closenesse, MeanDiff <2 means switch, Forward opt is done. Forward opt with perturbations for 15s (5sec trancient effects, 10 seconds to walk stably, two dist types (front and sag)). Final cost (no fall/stable walking) on energy and absolute speed and stability after dist. No stable walking found!
Rev55Hyb - Hybrid Opt. Combining all dists. in inverse, for fast speed (no inside), cost on closenesse, MeanDiff <2 means switch, Forward opt is done. Forward opt with perturbations for 15s (5sec trancient effects, 10 seconds to walk stably, two dist types (front and sag)).

Rev103For - Forward Opt, Standing still upright, (angle = 0), No Stable config found however can stand still for 8 sec.
Rev106For - Forward Opt, standing still, with 10 degrees of leg spread.
Rev117For - Foward Opt, standing still with 10 degrees of leg spread, RonL/LonR term removed (leg is not forced to got to swing, instead stays on ground). Standing for 10 sec. possible, before falling sideways. Might be due to initia stance being somewhat adducted in both legs.
Rev121For - Forward Opt, Standing still without spread, no XonX
Rev128For - Forward Opt, Standing still, spread, variable XonX with threshold (sag 0.225, front 0.125) and with CPG on ankle
Rev132For - Forward Opt, Standing still, spread, no hip adduction, no special result or succes
